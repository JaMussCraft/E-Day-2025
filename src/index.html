    <h2>
        Welcome to Air Draw! Have you ever wished you could draw in thin air and have a computer understand what you're
        sketching? That's what we're exploring today! This project is all about the magic of Artificial Intelligence
        (AI)
        - making computers smart enough to do things we usually think only humans can. We've combined a few cool AI
        techniques: Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and a Large Language Model to make it happen. Let's see how it
        all works!
    </h2>

    <p>
        Project Background: This is a demo built for E-Day 2025 at the University of Kentucky and Nosu AI Hackathon. The
        idea is to recreate
        the "Quick, Draw!" game from Google with a different way to draw and recognize the doodle. Instead of drawing
        with your fingers on a screen, you will "draw in the air".
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>Click on start to begin the game. You will need to give your browser permission to access your webcam.  Simply face your webcam and face
        your right hand with your index finger pointing up to the webcam and start drawing!
        Your doodle will be recognized by an LLM every 2 seconds or so, if the LLM guesses right then you win! You will
        need to make the LLM guess right under 20 seconds! </p>

            <h3>üî• LLM Temperature: Adjust the Creativity!</h3>
            <p>
                Imagine you're asking a friend to guess what you're drawing. Sometimes they're very focused and give you
                the most likely answer.
                Other times, they're feeling more creative and might guess something a bit more unusual, but still
                related. That's what this
                "temperature" slider controls! In our project, we're not using a typical drawing recognition model.
                Instead, we're using something
                called a Large Language Model (LLM). Think of an LLM as a super-smart chatbot that's really good with
                words and understanding
                what they mean. We ask the LLM to figure out your drawing! A lower temperature (closer to 0) makes the
                LLM more focused and
                precise ‚Äì it will try to give you the "safest," most probable guess. A higher temperature makes it more
                adventurous and imaginative.
                It might come up with some surprising, creative guesses that are still related to your drawing! Slide it
                around and see how the
                LLM's personality changes!

            <h3>üß† Choose Your AI Brain: Different Models, Different Styles!</h3>
            <p>
                Just like people have different strengths and ways of thinking, Large Language Models (LLMs) also have
                their own unique personalities!
                This control lets you pick which "brain" we're using to understand your air drawing. Each LLM has been
                trained on a massive amount
                of text and code, but they learn in slightly different ways. One model might be better at recognizing
                everyday objects, while another
                might be a bit more abstract in its thinking. By switching models, you can see how the interpretation of
                your drawing changes. It's
                like getting a second (or third, or fourth...) opinion from different AI experts! Try them all out and
                see which one "gets" your
                drawing style the best! This demonstrates that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to AI.

            <h3>üëÄ See Your Hand Through the AI's Eyes: Hand Landmarks!</h3>
            <p>
                How does the computer "see" your hand in the first place? That's where Computer Vision comes in! This is
                a type of AI that allows
                computers to "understand" images and videos. In Air Draw, we're using a computer vision models developed by MediaPipe Studio to track
                your hand's movements. This toggle lets you see exactly what the computer sees: little dots called
                "landmarks" placed on different
                parts of your hand, like your fingertips and knuckles. These landmarks are like a map of your hand that
                the computer uses to
                follow your drawing. It's like seeing the world through the AI's eyes! By understanding where your hand
                is and how it's moving,
                the system can translate your air gestures into a drawing.

            <p>
                By combining Computer Vision, Machine
                Learning and LLMs, we can create interactive and intuitive experiences that blur the lines between the
                digital and physical worlds. We hope this inspires you to explore the world of AI. <br><br>

                <strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> The broad concept of creating machines that can perform
                tasks that
                typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.<br><br>

                <strong>Computer Vision:</strong> A field of AI that enables computers to "see" and interpret
                visual information from
                images or videos, just like humans do.<br><br>

                <strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> A type of AI where computers learn from data without
                being explicitly programmed.
                They find patterns and relationships in the data to make predictions or decisions.<br><br>

                <strong>Large Language Model (LLM):</strong> A powerful type of AI that has been trained on a
                massive amount of text
                data. LLMs can understand, generate, and translate human language with impressive accuracy. They power
                many of the AI applications you use every day like chatbots, writing aids, and more!
